WebLogo 3: Sequence Logos Redrawn
===================================

WebLogo is software designed to make the generation of sequence logos easy and painless. A sequence logo is a graphical representation of an amino acid or nucleic acid multiple sequence alignment. Each logo consists of stacks of symbols, one stack for each position in the sequence. The overall height of the stack indicates the sequence conservation at that position, while the height of symbols within the stack indicates the relative frequency of each amino or nucleic acid at that position. In general, a sequence logo provides a richer and more precise description of, for example, a binding site, than would a consensus sequence.

WebLogo features a web interface (http://weblogo.threeplusone.com), and a command line interface provides more options
and control (http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/manual.html#CLI). These pages document the API.

The main WebLogo webserver is located at http://weblogo.threeplusone.com

Please consult the manual for installation instructions and more information:
(Also located in the weblogolib/htdocs subdirectory.)

.. code-block:: console

    weblogo  < cap.fa > logo0.eps

To run as a standalone webserver at localhost:8080
