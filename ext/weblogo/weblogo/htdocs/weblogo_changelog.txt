3.4  (2014-06-03)  [Gavin Crooks, Eric Talevich]

* Python 3
	Weblogo now runs under python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 & 3.4 (Python 2.5 is no longer
	supported.) Note that the api for creating a logo has changed. See docs. 
	(Kudos: Eric Talevic)
* Fix bug with using Ghostscript 9.10 (Issue 36)
	(Kudos: Michael Imbeault, Estienne Swart, FiReaNG3L)
* Fix various bugs in transfac parsing.

	(Kudos: Kamil Slowikowski, Jacob Engelbrecht)



3.3 (2012-07-02) [Gavin Crooks, David Sivak]

* Improved the algorithm that guesses the sequence type (DNA, RNA or protein) 
	(Kudos: Bug report, Roland Pache)
* Fixed an issue with reading transfac matrices with alternative alphabets 
	(Kudos: Bug report, Nima Emami)
* Fixed Motif.reindex()

	(Can now reverse complement transfac matrix input on the command line.)
	(Kudos: Feature request, Seth P Boudreaux)
* Command line interface now automagically recognizes transfac files. 
* Add command line option "--reverse-stacks NO" which inverts the logo stacks
	so that the most conserved monomers are at the bottom of the stack, rather than
	the top. This ordering is consistent with the standard ordering for histograms,
	and is arguably a better representation.
	(Kudos: Luke Hutchison)
* Fixed an issue so that the correct color scheme is chosen 
	for the specified sequence type.
* Miscellaneous minor bug fixes and refactoring.

* Miscellaneous minor bug fixes and refactoring.

* Incorporates bug fixes and feedback from Gavin Crooks, John Gilman, 
Kevin Schutz and Perry Evan.



3.0 (2008-10-14) [GEC]

A significant update of WebLogo.

New and improved feature include:

* Simplified GUI. More useful options, less obscure options that are rarely
  used.
* Several choices of unit including bits and nats, and corresponding energy 
  measures such as kJ/mol.
* Error bars are smaller and more discrete.
* The size of logo stacks is consistent (Does not change with sequence length.)
* The width of the characters in a stack are scaled by the fraction of non-gaps.
  Therefore gappy columns are visually less important than columns with gaps.
* Three standard logo sizes.
* Can now read many multiple sequence alignment formats, including
  CLUSTALW, FASTA, plain flatfile, MSF, NBRF, PIR, NEXUS and PHYLIP.
* High resolution PNG output.
* New, rational, easy to use command line client.
* Python based API library.
* New color schemes, including Watson-Crick pairing, hydrophobicity and charge.
* I (Isolucine) now shows crossbars, so that the letter is distinguishable
  from a line.
* Colors can be specified using CSS2 syntax.
* Optional figure label.
* Conservation is now calculated as the Bayesian posterior mean relative
  entropy. (This is the most significant change scientifically. The math
  needed to get this right is very interesting.)
* Similarly, we now display Bayesian 95% confidence intervals for error bars.
* Compositional adjustment.

* Includes contributions from Clare Gollnick, David Ding, John Gilman.
* Incorporates bug fixes and feedback from John Reid, Gordon Robertson, 
  Eric Odell, Krisztina Gabor, ...
* Incorporates or adapts ideas and code from Gary Hon, Steven Brenner,      
     John-Marc Chandonia, Liana Lareau, Ed Green, James Casbon, Jeffrey Chang,
     Frank Kauff, Cymon J. Cox,   ...
